         <h2><i>'Thriller' became one of the most influential albums ever!</i> </h2>
          
         <ul>
                
                <li><p>Across 1983 and 1984, it would rack up 37 non-consecutive weeks in the top position, making it the best-selling album of each of those years</p></li>
                <br>
                <li><p>Each of Thriller’s 7 tracks released as singles made the Top Ten in the U.S. </li>
                <br>
                <li><p>25 y.o. Jackson began changing the shape of music videos and treated them as actual filmmaking. MTV was going to pass on airing the video for 'Billie Jean' until they were taken to task by CBS Records president Walter Yetnikoff; he not only promised that his label would boycott the still-young network, he swore that everyone would know that MTV’s primary reason for refusal was that they didn’t see a Black artist like Jackson fitting their vision for the network. MTV gave-in and the video’s popularity erupted. The one-two punch of Jackson and Prince in ’82 and ’83 opened the doors for Black artists on MTV.</p> </li>
                <br>
                <li><p>The 13-minute 42-second 'Thriller' music video is the only music video in the US National Film Registry. The Library of Congress gives this honor to <q>culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant recordings</q>.</p></li>
                <br>
                <li><p>Having been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America, the album is said to have sold over 70 million copies worlwide making it the highest selling album of all time by an individual artist. </p></li>
                <br>
                <li><p>Ethnomusicologist Miles White, the album completely defined the <q>sound of post-disco contemporary R&B</q> and <q>updated the crossover aesthetic that had been the holy grail of black popular music since Louis Jordan in the 1940s</q>.</p></li>
