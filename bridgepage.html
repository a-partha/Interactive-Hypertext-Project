        <p>The song 'Rock With You' from 'Off The Wall' can be considered as a bridge between disco and pop; not as fast as a disco song, but has strong disco elements. It's sprinkled with strings, horns and a nice feeling which makes you want to dance but the drums aren't playing 4/4 which is a disco signature. It's also softer and subtler than a traditional disco track but clearly has a different sound found in later pop music.</p>
