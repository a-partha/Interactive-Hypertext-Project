        <p>After successful records with his brothers as part of Jackson 5/The Jacksons, but lukewarm responses to his subsequent solo projects, Michael finally moved from Motown Records to sign with Epic Records.</p>
        <p>Their first release was 'Off The Wall', which was produced by Quincy Jones, whom he met while working on the 1978 film 'The Wiz'. 
            It was the duo's first of three legendary collaborations which includes 'Thriller' and 'BAD'. </p>
        <p>Several critics observed that 'Off The Wall' was crafted from disco, pop, funk, R&B, soft rock and Broadway ballads. Its lyrical themes include escapism, liberation, loneliness, hedonism and romance. </p>
        <p>The album features songwriting contributions from Stevie Wonder, Paul McCartney, Rod Temperton, Tom Bahler, and David Foster, alongside three tracks penned by Jackson himself. </p>
