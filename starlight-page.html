         <p>Oh and one last thing - The song that everyone knows as 'Thriller' started out with a different title and lyrics. When originally written by Rod Temperton, it was called 'Starlight'. The idea was to write a song befitting of Jackson's love for cinema and his evolving persona. Quincy Jones thought that it should be the album's title track, but that Starlight was a weak title for it. He asked Temperton to reimagine the song with scarier overtones.</p>
         <p>In an interview, Temperton said:</p>
         <q id="quote">Quincy said to me,<i> ‘You managed to come up with a title for the last album, see what you can do for this album.’ </i>So I went back to the hotel, wrote two or three hundred titles, and came up with the title ‘Midnight Man’. The next morning, I woke up, and I just said this word - ‘Thriller'. Something in my head just said, this is the title. You could visualise it on the top of the Billboard charts. You could see the merchandising for this one word, how it jumped off the page as ‘Thriller’.</q>
         <p>Once the new title was settled upon, Temperton supposedly wrote the entire lyrics in just a couple of hours! </p>
